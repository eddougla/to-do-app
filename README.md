Development of a To-Do App (DOM & CRUD)

Goal of the project:

Develop a simple To-Do App that allows users to create, modify and delete to-dos.

Fundamental Concepts

•	Syntax and Structure: Practicing JavaScript syntax, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
•	Functions: Learning how to create and use functions to encapsulate logic.

DOM Manipulation

•	Document Object Model (DOM): Understanding how to interact with and manipulate HTML elements, such as adding, removing, and updating tasks dynamically.
•	Events: Handling user interactions (like clicks and key presses) to update the UI.

Data Management

•	State Management: Managing and maintaining the state of the application, such as keeping track of tasks in an array.
•	Local Storage: Learning how to use the browser’s local storage API to save tasks so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

User Interface Design

•	UI/UX Principles: Designing a user-friendly interface, improving layout, and understanding usability principles.
•	Styling: Possibly integrating CSS to style the application, enhancing both aesthetic appeal and user experience.

Version Control

•	Git & GitHub: Practicing version control and collaborating on projects using platforms like GitHub.

Problem-Solving Skills

•	Debugging: Enhancing problem-solving skills by identifying and fixing bugs or unexpected behavior in the application.
•	Algorithm Design: Developing algorithms to sort or filter tasks based on different criteria.

Project Management

•	Planning and Execution: Understanding the project lifecycle from planning features to executing them systematically.
•	Documentation: Learning the importance of documenting your code and decisions for clarity and future reference.

Community and Sharing

•	Portfolio Building: Having a tangible product to showcase your skills to potential employers or collaborators.
•	Feedback and Iteration: Sharing your application for feedback, which is useful for learning and improving.

Minimum requirements

1.	Basic Functionality (Difficulty: Medium)
•	Develop a web application that allows the user to create new to-dos.
•	 The to-dos should be displayed in a list as soon as they are created.
•	Implement functionality that allows the user to change existing to-dos.
•	Offer the user the option to delete to-dos.

2.	User Interface (Difficulty: Easy)
•	Make the user interface appealing and intuitive. Use HTML and CSS for layout and design.
•	Each to-do should have an edit and a delete button.
•	Show the number of remaining to-dos in the interface.

3.	Interactivity (Difficulty: Medium)
•	Keep the to-do list updated dynamically without the need to reload the page.
•	Implement a feature that allows the user to delete all to-dos at once.

Optional requirements

4.	 Storage of to-dos (Difficulty: Medium)
•	The to-dos should be saved in the browser's local storage so that they are still available after the page is reloaded.
•	Use JavaScript to write the to-dos to Local Storage and read them from there.

5.	Filter function (Difficulty: Advanced)
•	Add a filter function that allows the user to filter the to-dos according to "done" and "unfinished".

GitHub exercise

•	Upload the code to a GitHub repository and ensure that all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are well structured and commented.
•	Create a README file that contains a short description of the project, instructions on how to use it, and information about the implemented features.
